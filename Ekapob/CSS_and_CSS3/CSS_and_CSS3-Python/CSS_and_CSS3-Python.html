                            I'll be sure to note that in my log. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Not if I weaken first. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf.
