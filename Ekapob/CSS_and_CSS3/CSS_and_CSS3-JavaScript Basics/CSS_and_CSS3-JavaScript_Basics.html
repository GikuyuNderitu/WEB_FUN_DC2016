                    You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We have a saboteur aboard. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. How long can two people talk about nothing? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. This should be interesting. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me.

                            Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise.
